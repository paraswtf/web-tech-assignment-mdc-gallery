        <p align="center">With this goal, the National Education Policy (2020) focuses on providing holistic,
            comprehensive education
            and emphasises interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary studies. Following the NEP guidelines, the UGC has
            mandated nine credits of multidisciplinary courses for undergraduate education - 3 courses of 3 credits
            each. SIU has planned to leverage its expertise across institutes/ disciplines, with each institute offering
            courses to a group of students from various disciplines. By sitting together in the same classroom for these
            courses, the students will have a genuinely multidisciplinary experience at the college level.</p>
